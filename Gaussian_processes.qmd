## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
train_X = [[0], [0.5]]
train_y = [   1,     2]
```

```{python}
import sklearn.metrics
dist_XX = sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances(train_X)
```

```{python}
def squared_exponential(distance):
    """Using RBF covariance kernel, get rid of **2 to change to Laplaccian"""
    return np.exp(distance**2 / -2)
kern_XX = squared_exponential(dist_XX)
kern_XX
```


```{python}
test_X = [[1]]
X = train_X + test_X
print(X)
squared_exponential(
              sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances(
                X
              ))
```


```{python}
predictions = []
xs = np.linspace(0.5, 5)
for x in xs:
  test_X = [[x]]
  kern_xX = squared_exponential(
              sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances(test_X, train_X))
  test_y = kern_xX.dot(np.linalg.inv(kern_XX)).dot(train_y)[0]
  predictions.append(test_y)
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
xs = np.concatenate(([0,.5], xs))
obs_plus_predicted = [1,2] + predictions
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(xs, obs_plus_predicted, marker = 'o')
plt.show()
```
Nice and smooth with a peak at around $x=1$
